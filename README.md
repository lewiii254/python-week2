## List Operations in Python
This script demonstrates fundamental list operations in Python. It performs a series of manipulations on a list and includes the following steps:
Features
- Creation of an Empty List
  * Initializes an empty list named my_list.
- Appending Elements
  * Adds the elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list using the append() method.
- Inserting an Element
  * Inserts the value 15 at the second position in the list using the insert() method.
- Extending the List
  * Extends my_list with another list [50, 60, 70] using the extend() method.
- Removing the Last Element
  * Removes the last element from the list using the pop() method.
- Sorting the List
  * Sorts my_list in ascending order using the sort() method.
- Finding an Element's Index
  * Finds and prints the index of the value 30 in the sorted list using the index() method.

## Usage
To run the script:
- Copy the code to a Python file
- Run the script using Python:
  
- The output will display the index of the value 30 in the sorted list.
Example Output
- After running the script, the following output will be displayed:
The index of 30 in my_list is: 2
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Learning Objectives

Understand and implement basic list operations.
